        <h2><b>Fyre Festival:</b> <br><b> The Influenza of Wanting Social Media Exclusivity</b></h2>
        <p class="long-copy">The much-anticipated Festival of 2017, promised festival-goers two luxury weekends on a private island in the Bahamas, once owned by the infamous <i>Pablo Escobar</i>. The festival weekends were promoted by supermodel <i>Kendall Jenner</i> on Instagram and soon caught “fire” as the next big exclusive event on social media called Fyre Festival. In 2016 the organizers of <b>Fyre Festival</b> created a promo video with models like <i>Bella Hadid</i> and <i>Hailey Baldwin</i> sunbathing on a yacht in skimpy bikinis in the Bahamas. This would-be the tropical Coachella of music festivals emerged seemingly out of nowhere but soon catapulted to viral status after the influence of Instagram about the event. The festival campaign promised the best of the best in VIP luxury, top notch entertainment, and exclusivity to festival-goers. None of that ever happened.</p><br>
        
       <p class="long-copy">Masterminded, <i>Billy McFarland</i> and rapper <i>Ja Rule</i> were “the so-called brains” behind Fyre Festival. After a somewhat success with a version of the AmEx like black card that also served as an elite club membership called Magnises, McFarland created the Fyre app and Fyre Media. This app was meant to operate sort of like Tinder, pairing up users with artists, who could deny or approve a request to be booked for an event and set their own booking fees. And this is where the Fyre Festival was born: McFarland and his team wanted to promote the app by throwing a music festival.</p><br>

        <p class="long-copy">Hundreds of tickets were sold to the Fyre Festival, and leading up to the festival date all seem to be well, or that is what they all chose to believe. But, there were clear warning signs that all was not right in paradise by many chose to ignore the signals for whatever reason. <i>Calvin Wells</i> a venture capitalist created a post <b>@fryefraud</b> and sent out many post with evidence of what was the state of the Fyre Festival preparation but barely got any response to his claims. Less than a month before the festival, one of the first articles depicting issues with the festival came out. <b>The Wall Street Journal</b> reported on April 2 of 2017 that artists hadn’t been paid, VIP guests didn’t have their travel itineraries with flight information, and claims that the festival was “wooing the wealthy” just to make ends meet.</p><br>

        <p class="long-copy">Fyre Festival had arrived and guess started bombarding the island of the Bahamas with great anticipation of what was promised only to be quickly disappointed by disaster, chaos and out-wright fraud welcoming them to Fyre Festival. There was no luxury Jet, no VIP treatment, no villas, no yacht, no entertainment, and barely any food or accommodation awaiting them. There was only one thing festival-goers received from the promo video presented by Fyre Festival, and that was exclusivity of an experience. An experience festival-goers sorted after because they wanted bragging right of exclusiveness to this luxury event. They also wanted social recognition from everyone within their social environment to know they had the means to experience this one of a kind event but instead they were all duped and shame on that very platform, they hoped would promote their social status after Fyre Festival.</p><br> 

        <p class="long-copy">We are now living in a social media frenzy world, where everyone wants everyone to know their every move and accomplishment. Fyre Festival, was the physical manifestation of the false narrative that social media creates. It was a fantasy world that so many people get caught up in and sometimes cannot discern what their true realty is in life and that is what happened with the Fyre Festival goers. Just smoke, no “fire.” There were definite warning signs but they all chose to ignore them for the fantasy embedded from what was first presented to them by social media.</p><br>
 
        <p class="long-copy">In the end, there were many disappointment, shame, and lawsuit for Festival-goers. Billy McFarland was sentence to six years in prison for the Fyre festival fraud.  JaRule quickly remove himself from being responsible for the disaster of Fyre Festival by tweeting a statement saying he was “heartbroken” about the whole thing and apologize to festival goers, but said that the disaster was <b>“NOT MY FAULT.”</b></p><br>
 
        <p class="long-copy">I true believe this festival was the fault of all the major team players who were involve and not just Billy McFarland because no one person took responsibility for their action. They all saw the warning signs of this disaster but chose to go along with the rouse for whatever selfish reason. No one ever wants to look atrocious on social media, but Fyre Festival was whole lot of atrociousness at social media finest.</p></p>
