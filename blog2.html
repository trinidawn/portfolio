   <h2><b>Why Beauty Matters?</b></h2>
        <p class="long-copy"><b>What is beauty? Why should it matter?</b> According to British philosopher and author <b><i>Sir Roger Scruton</b></i> in his documentary, "Why beauty matters," he incisively examines the importance of beauty in the arts and our everyday lives. Scruton states in his introduction: "I think we are losing the beauty and with it, there is the danger of losing the meaning of life." Scruton argues art, architecture, and music has turned their backs on beauty, making a cult of ugliness and leading us into a spiritual desert.</p><br>
         
        <p class="long-copy">Philosophers have argued that through the pursuit of beauty we shape the world as a home. We also come to understand our own nature as spiritual beings. But our world has turned its back on beauty and because of that, we find ourselves surrounded by ugliness and alienation. For Scruton, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, it is an objective truth, a classical notion, but one that is completely revolutionary in today's art marketplace. I do agree that beauty does matter. But who should decide what is beauty? The "individual beholder" or a "community of individuals."</p><br>
         
        <p class="long-copy">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder is a commonly used expression. It applies not just to issues of physical beauty but also to anything proposed as perfect and desirable. Whether or not beauty is subjective or objective has been argued about since the times of ancient Greece. Greek philosophers, like <i>Socrates</i>, <i>Plato</i>, and <i>Aristotle</i>, considered beauty an absolute manifest in order, symmetry, and proportion. But, Skeptics, Epicureans, and Stoics nudged towards an understanding that beauty exists in symmetry (objective) and in eurhythmy (subjective). Chinese philosopher, <i>Confucius</i> is credited with saying, "Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it."</p><br> 
        
        <p class="long-copy">I will first explain why I somewhat agree that beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, like Scruton. When there are grave disagreements in discussions about what's good and bad in architecture or art there's often someone around who will quickly utter: <b>"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder."</b> It's a phrase with the power to silence. Once it's been uttered, trying to keep up a dialogue about the merits or drawbacks of certain visual things can come across as shrill, anti-social or just plain rude.  However, the phrase is almost always unwarranted and deeply troublesome to some individuals and I feel like no one believes in it to its core. We may well accept that there can be legitimate differences in taste within a reasonable spectrum, but we don't actually think that all tastes are equal.</p><br>  
        
        <p class="long-copy">If beauty simply lay in the eye of beholders, then it would presumably be sane to stand up and assert that a rubbish dump smelling of urine and decomposing fecal matter was a lovely place: And that Central Park is a hideous place to visit in New York and it might then be logical to suggest that it would be OK to make the park into said rubbish dump.
        But of course, no one would want that which shows that in reality, we don't actually believe that beauty only lies entirely in the eye of beholders. We choose to agree and disagree about aesthetic principles and are very much aware of moments when our tastes might clash with those of another.</p><br> 
        
        <p class="long-copy">I take issue with Roger Scruton equating beauty, as a surface quality sensed from the eye of the beholder to the values of truth and goodness. It seems to me that truth and goodness are more foundational, necessary, edifying in life than beauty. Truth and goodness are subsurface and cannot be rejected for any good reason. I don't necessarily look at art and architecture in the spectrum of beauty. In my eyes, I see art of any kind to be more thought-provoking, to be interpreted by the individual it is presented to and not be classified as beauty. Beauty should not be only seen in the physical or dematerialize things as Roger Scruton seem to indicate in his documentary as a fading reality for humanity.</p><br>  
        
        <p class="long-copy">I think beauty is found inside of an individual person. I believe beauty derives from our personality, our words, our values, our heart, our truth, our goodness, and who we are as human beings are a true beauty. This kind of beauty cannot be judged objectively, for what one person finds beautiful or admirable may not appeal to another. It is another way of saying that beauty is subjective.</p>
